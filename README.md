## Features / Usage

Interactive game: guessing a number between 1 and 20.

1) The player starts with a score of 20, and every wrong answer deducts a point.
2) If the player guesses correctly, the check button and input box are disabled, and if the current score is higher than the high score, the high score is updated.
3) On pressing 'again', the check button and input box are enabled, and the score resets.
